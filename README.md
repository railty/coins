# Coins.js

This is a little coin machine example I made using the [three.js](https://threejs.org/) 
Javascript 3D library. I used [Physijs](http://chandlerprall.github.io/Physijs/) 
for the physics. The cabinet and coin models I created in [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) .
I used a SMAA shader for edge smoothing to improve performance. 

I will continue to add to this example when I have time, but it hopefully will
be a good starting point for anybody wishing to create their own arcade game.

The game in it's current state can be played [here](https://mickeyuk.github.io/projects/coins.js).
